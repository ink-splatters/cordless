# Non-TOS compliant fork of Discordgo

This fork allows usage of normal discord accounts. The support isn't really
proper and API versions might differ from endpoint to endpoint.

Both examples and documentation have been deleted, simply because I am to
lazy to keep them updated.

Fixes from the official library might be merged over from time to time, but no
changes go the other way, as discordgo didn't want to accept changes regarding
normal user accounts in the past.
